# Technical Interview

- This is a technical interview in which we'll ask you to talk through a system that you have already built from design to production. (If you do not have any code running in production to discuss, anything that has been consumed by another party also works.)

- This is not a live coding interview. You will not be asked to write code on the spot.

- We are looking to get a sense of how you think about the lifecycle of the code. Be able to talk in depth about the choices you made and why.

## General Tips:
- Test your screen sharing with Google meet ahead of time.
- This does not need to be your proudest work. Bringing in something that you can speak to in depth is more important.
- Make sure to communicate what your specific role was in creating this piece of code. Be prepared to discuss how you would improve it and feel free to solicit the opinion of your interviewers. Part of this interview is we want to see what it would be like to work with you.
- Familiarize yourself with CoreOS and its tools by going through the tutorial prerequisites and the first tutorial
