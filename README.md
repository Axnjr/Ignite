# Overview 

This project was developed during my internship at **Dynamite**.  It serves as a **MonoRepo** for all the `Rust backend` components used in the project.  

### Other Components:
- [**The Web App**](https://github.com/Axnjr/Ignition-Web)  
- [**Client Pub-Sub SDK (JavaScript)**](https://github.com/Ignition-Dev/Js-Sdk)  
- [**Test Playground**](https://github.com/Ignition-Dev/Js-Sdk/tree/main/playground)  
- [**Lambda Functions**](https://github.com/Axnjr/dailyCronJob)

# Example Usage 
Users need to get their `API_KEY` by creating their account. Hobby users get 100 daily requests and 10 con-current connections to exceed this limit users can subscribe to other paid plans. To interact with `Ignition` you can use the language specific SDK'S, untill now only JS SDK is available ðŸ˜…, below is sample of how to use it:
```js
import Ignition from "ignition-js-sdk";

let ws = new Ignition({
    url: process.env.IGNITION_WSS_URL,
    apiKey: process.env.IGNITION_API_KEY,
    encryptionKey:"RADHA" // IF YOU WANT TO ENCRYPT YOUR MESSAGES. MESSAGES NEED TO BE DECRYPTED USING THE SAME KEY ON THE OTHER END !
})

ws.subscribe("test") // eventName

ws.on("test", (data) => { // eventName, callback
	console.log("message recived by `b`:",data)
})

ws.emit("test", "test", "hello world") // eventName: String, channelName: String, message: Any

ws.emit("test", "test", {
  "Name": "Axn",
  "Age": 21,
  "Occupation": "SDE"
})

ws.emit("tes", "test", 56);
```

# Architecture 

- **Hobby** and **Pro** requests are handled by the [`ignition_shared_v5`](https://github.com/Axnjr/Ignite/tree/main/ignition_shared_v5) container, which is deployed using **AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS)**.  
- For **Enterprise** clients, a dedicated instance is provisioned with the [`dedicated_v2`](https://github.com/Axnjr/Ignite/tree/main/WssDedicated) container for optimal performance. ðŸ’¥
